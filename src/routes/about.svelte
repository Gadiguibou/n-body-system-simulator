<h2>What is an <i>n</i>-body system?</h2>

<p>The term "<i>n</i>-body problem" generally refers to the problem of trying to predict the motion of planets, stars, moons, asteroids, or, more generally, <strong>celestial bodies</strong>. Although there's no known general analytical solution to this problem<sup>[<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">1</a>]</sup>, it's easy to simulate the movement of those bodies approximately using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation">Newton's law of universal gravitation</a>.</p>

<h2>What is this website?</h2>

<p>It's a <a href=#how-was-this-made>simple</a> interactive n-body simulation that allows anyone to play with the initial parameters to see how it affects the bodies' orbits. Hopefully, somebody finds it as fascinating as I do to discover how simple changes in the initial parameters can lead to wildly different outcomes.</p>

<h2>Whenever I change the parameters of the simulation, the planets just crash into each other or are ejected outside of the screen, never to be seen again...</h2>

<p>It's pretty hard to get a system with anything above to 2 bodies to reach a stable state. In fact, it's so hard that mathematicians and scientists have been scratching their heads over this for <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem#History">decades</a>. Here are a few interesting orbits that I managed to come up with (or stole from math papers) to help you get started:</p>

<h2 id="how-was-this-made">How was this made? What technologies does it use?</h2>

<p>This website uses almost exclusively vanilla HTML and Javascript with a few lines of CSS and is served as a static website using <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a>. The graphics for the simulation use the <code><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas">&lt;canvas&gt;</a></code> HTML element and the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D"><code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code></a> interface for rendering. I also used <a target="_blank" href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> to make the form for editing simulation parameters reactive. The entire source for this website is available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Gadiguibou/n-body-system-simulator">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>The complex patterns that appear out of seemingly simple initial parameters fascinate me and I have a passion for programming and learning more about pretty much anything. Therefore, making this simulator seemed like the perfect opportunity to learn more about the Canvas API. I ended up having so much fun with it, that I decided to add a form to make it easier for non-techy people around me to play with it and experience the same awe at the emerging patterns in the motion of the planets.</p>

<h2>Who are you?</h2>

<p>I'm a second year software engineering student at McGill University with a passion for math, science and learning. You can find more of my projects on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Gadiguibou">GitHub profile</a>. I also have a small <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gabriellacroix.com/">website</a> that I don't maintain actively. This looks like the perfect opportunity to mention that I'm looking for an internship in software development and related fields for the summer of 2022.

<h2>Can I use this for <i>X</i>? Modify it? Sell it?</h2>

<p>Yes.
